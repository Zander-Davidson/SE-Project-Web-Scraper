The course should be helpful to anyone whose practice may involve representing those who interact with the oil and gas industry, such as landowners, as well as those students considering an oil and gas related career. The guiding approach to the class is to provide the student with familiarity and understanding of the law that is involved in the real-world drilling, completing, and selling production from oil and gas operations, including today's unconventional plays, such as the Fayetteville Shale Play in Central Arkansas.
