    "Description" : "Oil and gas exploration and production is an important component of the economy of Arkansas and neighboring states. Out of necessity, this industry is highly regulated in every jurisdiction, but the manner of regulation varies widely from state to state. This course examines the rationale for such regulation, while comparing the regulatory approach of three neighboring states, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma which are typical examples of varying types of regulation. This course is designed to complement, rather than duplicate the basic Oil and Gas course, and will normally use the same casebook. A primary goal of this course is to learn how this regulation both shapes and constrains the ways that oil and gas industry operates. We also examine forms of agreement commonly used in oil and gas transactions to help students understand the functions of those, as well as their typical provisions. The course should be helpful to anyone whose practice may involve representing those who interact with the oil and gas industry, such as landowners, as well as those students considering an oil and gas related career.
